DONT CHANGE TO NAME STRING IN THE MENU ITS TO GIVE ME CRED FOR THE MENU IF YOU REMOVE IT YOU ARE A SKID!! ðŸ˜¡

I MADE FLING ALL FIRST DONT SKID WITHOUT GIVING CRED!!!


Im gonna keep updating to menu so be on the lookout for new updates.

If Alien Tag gets the 1.3 brain cells needed to make a decent AntiCheat it will be bypassed so dont worry about this getting patched it wont.

This Menu is a side proj its not my main project so there wont be a ton of updates.
